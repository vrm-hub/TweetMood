# TweetMood: Sentiment Analysis of Tweets

TweetMood is an exploratory sentiment analysis project aimed at gauging public sentiment from Twitter data. Utilizing a range of machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks, the project sifts through tweets to determine the underlying emotional tone â€” be it positive, negative, or neutral.

## Project Overview

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and classify the sentiment of tweets. By training on a dataset of pre-labeled tweets, our models learn to detect sentiment cues and patterns, providing insights into public opinion on various topics.

### Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleansing tweets for NLP (removing hashtags, mentions, links, and non-alphanumeric characters).
- **Model Training**: Implementing and comparing different sentiment analysis models.
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Evaluating model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **User Interface**: Simple UI for live sentiment analysis of user-input tweets.

### Models

- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic model based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions.
- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical model that in this context is used for binary classification of tweet sentiment.
- **Neural Network**: A deep learning model with an architecture designed specifically for text data.

## Installation

To set up TweetMood for development and testing, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TweetMood.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd TweetMood
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run sentiment analysis on your tweets, execute:

```sh
python tweetmood.py "<your_tweet_here>"
```

Replace `<your_tweet_here>` with the tweet you want to analyze.
